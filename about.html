	<h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
	<p>
		My name is Seth Gholson. I am a 30 year old software developer originally from Shreveport, LA where I obtained a <a href="http://www.lsus.edu/academics/graduate-studies/graduate-programs/master-of-science-in-computer-systems-technology">Masters of Science in Computer Systems Technology</a> from <a href="http://www.lsus.edu">LSU Shreveport</a> and a Bachelor of General Studies from <a href="http://www.latech.edu">Louisiana Tech University</a>. I moved to the wonderful city of Austin, TX in 2012 with my wife and two sons.

	<p>
		I spend the majority of my professional and personal spare time working and playing with technology. I'm a bit of a late bloomer - I didn't begin my software career until I was 4 years out of undergraduate school. Now that I've realized where my true passion lies, I have trouble pulling myself away from studying and playing with all of the latest and greatest framework, library, widget, or wompit that crops up on Hacker News. 
	</p>

	<h2>WHAT DO I DO?</h2>
	<p>Prior to 2009 I spent a couple of years working in IT. From that, I acquired experience with:
		<ul>
			<li>Windows XP/Vista/7</li>
			<li>Windows Server 2005/2008</li>
			<li>Active Directory</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
	<p>Since then, I've primarily cut my teeth in Microsoft's world:
		<ul>
			<li>C#</li>
			<li>WinForms</li>
			<li>ASP.NET WCF Services</li>
			<li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>And more recently, I've spent a moderate amount of professional and a signficiant amount of personal time on the mobile platforms. I've published apps on both platforms using:
		<ul>			
			<li>Java / Android</li>
			<li>Objective-C / iOS</li>
			<li>Titanium Mobile SDK</li>
		</ul>
