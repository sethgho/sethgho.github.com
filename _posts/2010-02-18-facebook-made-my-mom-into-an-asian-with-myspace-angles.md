Months ago when Facebook posted the update for their iPhone app to version 3.1, I immediately grabbed it. For those of us that enjoy using Facebook, I argue that it is one of the best iPhone apps available.

Push notification has been a long time coming, and I’ve enjoyed it as an alternative to email for notifications. The other big feature of the update was contact picture syncing. This wasn’t exactly something I was Jones’n’ for, but a welcome addition. I’ve had the same stagnant pictures of my contacts for years. Many of them came from my old <a title="HTC Wizard Clone" href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/02/11/cingulars-8125-now-available-to-one-and-all/" target="_blank">Cingular 8125</a> via Exchange syncing.

What I didn’t expect, however, was for Facebook to turn my mom into an Asian with some pretty serious <a title="It doesn't matter how ugly you are" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=myspace%20angles" target="_blank">Myspace angles</a>.


The thing that’s strange is I have no idea who this girl is. She’s not any of my friends on Facebook. I’ve never seen her. She’s never been in any of their profile pictures that I’ve seen or even in their photo albums.

What gives, Facebook? Have a little mix-up over there?
