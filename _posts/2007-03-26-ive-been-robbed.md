title: 'I’ve been robbed!'

---

I admit, Mondays aren’t my day. Mondays are at the bottom of my favorites list in 8th place just below “Funday,” a day I tried to convince my wife that God created just for me so that I would have time to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_Saga_of_Heroes">Vanguard</a>. It’s yet to work thus far, hence the reason it’s nearing the bottom of my list.

As I was saying, Monday’s aren’t my day. My disdain for the day has only been amplified by today’s morning events. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Champion">Sam Champion</a>, the most amazingly stereotypical weatherman and the butt of my morning humor, was absent this morning. What a way to kick off the week. *sigh*
<blockquote><em>As a side note, after looking up Sammy on Wikipedia for the above link, I question how this will come across. Apparently he’s a strong supporter of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT">LGBT</a></em> <em>community, and the standard dose of homophobia all straight men possess told me to post about something else so as not to come across gay. Ahh well. <img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20080330175252/http://www.microseth.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" /> That fact only further solidifies my belief that his hair is just a</em> <em>little </em>too<em> perfect and his teeth are just a little </em>too <em>white</em>.</blockquote>
To top things off, the local morning weatherman <a href="http://ktbs.com/about-team-mark-rowlett.cfm">Mark Rowlett</a> set me up for a fall. When Sam’s lowly replacement cut to the 10 second spot where the local weather is covered, Mark was there in all his glory. He started rambling about the dreaded day (Monday). He worked his way up through the week on to Thursday &amp; Friday. This was the moment. I drew in a breath, ready to let out an obnoxious wail of a chuckle, here he goes… ” and on Sa——” NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!1!!!! Sam’s replacement was back! They cut Mark off early! Oh the agony! You see, Jen (my wife) and I get joy out of the fact that Mark Rowlett puts no T’s in the world “Saturday.” It sounds like “Saurday.” It really is an incredible anomaly. You should check it out.
These are the sweet little nuggets of joy that help me along through my week. On this Monday, I have been robbed of two of them. Perhaps I’ll make up for it this Funday.

In other news, Bacon Ranch Pringles own my soul. Yum.
