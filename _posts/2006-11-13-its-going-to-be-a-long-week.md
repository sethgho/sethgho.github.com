title: 'It’s going to be a long week'

<p>Well, it’s Monday. And this somebody has undoubtedly got a case of ‘em. It’s not the typical Monday, though. It’s the “Pre-Wii” Monday. Just under a week left. The days are growing longer, though. I thought I’d chart out a graphical representation of it for ya, too. <img alt=":-)" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20080530033500/http://www.microseth.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" /></p>  <p><img title="When will wii finally get to hold our own wii!?" alt="When will wii finally get to hold our own wii!?" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20080530033500/http://www.microseth.com/images/wiidaygraph.png" width="466" height="356" /></p>  <p>As you can probably tell by now, I do, in fact, have the handwriting of a 4 1/2 year old. I’ve accepted that fact. You should too. </p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>&#160; I sold it a year later. The Wii sucked. The Wiimote accuracy turned out to be far less than it should, and the software developed was a major disappointment.</p>
