title: 'Booger Friday'

---

<p>So I’ve recently come to the conclusion that I like children. I’m not just saying that because I’ve accepted the fact that I’m going to have one very soon, and I’m not meaning it in a weird father-of-15-home-schooled-kids kind of way. Little people are just so freakin’ funny. Now, I don’t mean that to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_People_of_America">offend anyone</a>. I’m talkin about the kiddies here, folks.</p>  <p>As I was walking in the house after work yesterday evening Jen greeted me with the always wonderful hug and kiss. But the thing she said next was what broke from the routine.</p>  <p>“Garrison named our baby for us!”</p>  <p>This wouldn’t be terribly big news if, for instance, Garrison was somehow involved in the parenting of the baby, rather than being only 5 years older than the baby. Garrison is our 4 year old nephew, not Jen’s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Baby%27s_Daddy">baby daddy</a>. Now, in case you’re not familiar with family traditions, the name of a newborn is generally picked by the baby’s mother and father, not the mother and her nephew. I was sure that hilarity would follow.</p>  <p>“If it’s a girl, Booger Friday.”</p>  <p>What a whopper it was. Booger Friday. Wow. I love kids.</p>  <p>On a side note, Booger Friday is undoubtedly a boy’s name. What was he thinking? I mean, c’mon, the kid’s initials would be <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BFG9000">BFG</a>. Of course, either way, any offspring of mine is going to dominate with the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://www.totalbf2.com/potd/w.jpg">knife</a>. </p>
