<p>Lately I find myself mixing my PascalCase with my camelCase, calling alloc init instead of new, using [ ] instead of (), and writing awfully verbose method names all over the place. I justify my errors with a glimpse at my average day here lately:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.sethgholson.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/dailyFocus1.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Not to scale. Some margin of error. I focus on my family all day. I promise!" border="0" alt="Not to scale. Some margin of error. I focus on my family all day. I promise!" src="http://www.sethgholson.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/dailyFocus_thumb1.png" width="623" height="212" /></a></p>
