title: '#1 on my Christmas list…'

---

<p>It’s October 4th. We all know what that means. It’s time to start preparing for the upcoming holiday: Christmas.</p>  <p>So I’ve begun my Christmas shopping and already I’ve found what will undoubtedly be at the #1 spot on my list: The DVD Rewinder. Yes, that’s right. Unfortunately, my DVD player only plays them and doesn’t rewind them. It was one of the first DVD players out, so that was before rewind came standard. Now I have to use a separate device to rewind my DVDs.</p>  <p><img title="Now I don&#39;t have to throw away a DVD after I watch it!
