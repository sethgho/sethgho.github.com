<p>After an extensive 23 year study, I’ve reached the following results concerning coffee and its goodness. Yes, it’s goodness.   <br /><img title="Not good frozen... not good boiling." alt="Not good frozen... not good boiling." src="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://www.microseth.com/images/coffeequality.png" width="451" height="361" /></p>  <p>It’s not very good scalding/boiling, and it’s not terribly great frozen or stone cold, either. Coffeesicle. Ick. </p>
