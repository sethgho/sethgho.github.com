title: 'Something the Xbox 360 can do, but not my Wii…'

---

<p>Lock up. Repeatedly. At less than a month old. Pfaw!</p>  <p>So this has happened once or twice in the past few weeks, but I didn’t concern myself too much with it.</p>  <p>Last night, I knew it was going to be a good night of gaming. Brody (our 6 week old) had been up for a while, so I knew he was going to sleep hard for a good while. Time to play some Crackdown and get some of those achievements I’ve been studying up on.</p>  <p>– Insert Disc</p>  <p>– Watch the ridiculous number of contributor logos that I can’t skip</p>  <p>– Campaign - Solo Play</p>  <p>– Loading….</p>  <p>– I’m in the game! Take a step..</p>  <p>– Lock up.</p>  <p>Rinse &amp; repeat several times, sometimes I may make it as far as hopping into a vehicle, but that’s about it. Hmm. This sucks.</p>  <p>I pop in Rainbow Six: Vegas….</p>  <p><img title="No, it wasn&#39;t snowing inside my scope." alt="No, it wasn&#39;t snowing inside my scope." src="http://web.archive.org/web/20080330175252/http://microseth.com/images/360lockup.jpg" width="458" height="343" /></p>  <p>Blast! It did the same thing! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!</p>  <p>Next game I get from Gamefly’s definitely going to be a Wii game.</p>  <p>My wife says “It’s because it’s an xbox.” — She’s a die hard Nintendo Fangirl.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://www.morrowworld.com">Elder Scrolls of Morrowworld</a> (that’s just for you Chris) suggested I put it on a UPS and see if that helps. We did have a bit of storming yesterday, but it wasn’t going on while I was playing or anything. I’m going to give that a whirl and maybe try some nonsense I found online about clearing the cache. Hopefully one of the two will work.</p>  <p>If either of my readers have any suggestions, let me know. <img alt=";-)" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20080330175252/http://www.microseth.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" /></p>
