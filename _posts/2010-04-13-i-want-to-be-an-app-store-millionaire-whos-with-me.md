<p>My envy is becoming unbearable. I’m not sure how much more I can take of these mobile app <a title="Doodle Jump" href="http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20100405/meet-the-app-store-millionaires-the-brothers-behind-doodle-jump/?mod=ATD_rss" target="_blank">success</a>&#160;<a title="Car Locator" href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/01/android-market-gets-a-13000-per-month-success-story-of-its-own/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+Techcrunch+(TechCrunch)" target="_blank">stories.</a> People are making hundreds and thousands of dollars per month with their relatively simple apps. There’s a gold rush on the mobile frontier, and I’m just now learning how to use a pickaxe. </p>  <p>Honestly, I’d be happy just to have a product on an app store and receive a check for 99¢. One sale, and I’d feel like I’ve accomplished something. I don’t need to make <a title="Doodle Jump" href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/08/never-ending-goldrush-doodle-jump-for-iphone-smashes-through-3-million-sales/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+Techcrunch+(TechCrunch)" target="_blank">millions of dollars</a> like the guys that made Doodle Jump for the iPhone. </p>  <p>I’ve got a summer without classes. I’m determined to publish <em>something</em> either on the Android app store or maybe an <a title="I MAED A GAM3 W1TH Z0MB1ES 1N IT!!!1" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/27481/I_MAED_A_GAM3_W1TH_Z0MB1ES_1N_IT1_And_Sold_200K_Units.php" target="_blank">XNA project</a>. A simple gaming project is the most interesting to me, but a lack of artistic direction is always my biggest roadblock. Anyone interested in a little collaboration? I mean, look at Doodle Jump. We can do that!</p>
