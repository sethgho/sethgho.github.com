<p>Over a year ago, I lost my debit card. Naturally, I canceled it. Because I’m lazy, I had a number of bills auto debiting via that card. This made the process of moving to a new debit card a nightmare.</p>  <p>I forgot something, and it was my hosting provider. They didn’t call me or email me (from what I could tell) for months. My old website worked for quite a long time. One day it quit working, and they wanted their money. Well, a collection agency wanted their money. The <em>first</em> time I recognized the problem was when a <em>collection agency</em> called me. Of course I paid it immediately, but all of my data was gone. My account hasn’t been restored. I’m fine with that – the hosting provider (1and1) was terrible, hard to communicate with, and had a dreadful management panel. I also hated my old domain name. </p>  <p>When all of this went down, I was pretty busy with work and school and family, so I didn’t feel like I had enough time to spare worrying about some silly blog posts.</p>  <p>I woke up early today, over a year after that happened, and decided to address it. I made my way over to the <a href="http://www.archive.org/">Way Back Machine</a> and grabbed most of my old blog posts. Worked like a charm, other than missing pictures from some of the most recent posts.</p>  <p>I plan on implementing some automated backup solution for my data this time around.</p>  <p>Oh, and maybe post! That would be a great idea.</p>
