title: '360 Panorama - Occip.It View After Saving'

---

<p style="text-align: center;">Per the comment thread on Occipital's blog:﻿<a href="http://www.sethgholson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Capture.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-393" title="Occipital - Save after Uploading" src="http://www.sethgholson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Capture.png" alt="" width="498" height="69" /></a></p>
This took me a while to find. As I'm in Berlin right now, my phone doesn't work. I've pulled the SIM and I am just using it like an iPod touch. This has been a frustrating experience with regard to 360 Panorama because I rarely have an internet connection at the time that I take the panorama. All I can do is "Save", and not having it in their nifty <a title="Really it is" href="http://occipital.com/360/" target="_blank">"Immersively stunning way"</a> is a bit of a letdown.

The good news is twofold: They're going to address it in an update AND there's a way to manually recreate them with your saved image. First, upload them to <a href="http://www.yfrog.com" target="_blank">www.yfrog.com</a>. Luckily, they allow batch uploads. So if you're like me and took 52 of them, it's not too much trouble to upload them all.

Then the tedious part: making a list of all of the URLs created by the newly uploaded images. Once you make a list, just replace "yfrog.com/" with  "occip.it/py" and voila! you have an Occipital magic view of your 360 panorama after saving it.

If anyone has any quick way of creating a list of all of your yfrog images, I'd love to know.

It's not an elegant solution, but it should work until they update the app.

<strong>UPDATE: </strong>See comment for some of mine from my trip.

<strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> Checked for an app store update the very next day and it looks like they've addressed the problem.
