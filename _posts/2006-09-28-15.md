<p>That’s it! I can only handle this beautiful scenery for just so long. This room is getting to me. There’s zero character to it. So I’ve come to the conclusion that OMG I GOTTA PUT SOMETHING ON THE WALLS! Off to thinkgeek.com I go, but something tells me administration wouldn’t be too keen on this hanging on our wall:</p>  <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://www.microseth.com/images/achievement.jpg"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://www.microseth.com/images/achievement.jpg" /></a></p>  <p>Or, even better, my personal favorite:</p>  <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://www.microseth.com/images/procrastination.jpg"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://www.microseth.com/images/procrastination.jpg" width="402" height="334" /></a>    <br />No, they definitely won’t like that at all. Gah, no go on the walls for right now. But wait! Music! Ahh yes, nothing like music to add some <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pizazz">pizazz</a>! I see the younger drones around the offices that drill away at paperwork all day with small radios &amp; headphones. I <em>know</em> I can get away with that!But how? Off to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://www.google.com/">Google</a> I go!</p>  <p>I found this project called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://www.vibestreamer.com/">Vibe Streamer</a>. It’s surprisingly slick and easy to use for a free project. Just install the program and let it run in your system tray. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://www.portforward.com/routers.htm">Forward the port</a> (default is 8081), and voila! You can stream your music from any internet connection on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=293907">Internet Explorer</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>, and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> browsers.    <br /><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://www.microseth.com/images/vibe_ss2.png"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://www.microseth.com/images/vibe_ss2.png" width="218" height="187" /></a></p>  <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://www.microseth.com/images/vibe_ss1.png"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://www.microseth.com/images/vibe_ss1.png" width="214" height="162" /></a></p>  <p>It works wonderfully. You can manager an unlimited number of users &amp; groups. You can cap the bitrate for any specific user or group. You can even lock it down by IP address. The web interface is nice and simple. It could use a few more features, like adding multiple songs to the playlist at once. There might be a way to do this. If there is, then it isn’t obvious enough.</p>  <p>I’ve still got some more playing around to do with it, but at first glance it’s a great package. It certainly looks a lot better than something like <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080213041853/http://www.turnstyle.com/andromeda/">Andromeda</a>. Hopefully they’ll develop a linux based version in the future! </p>
