I enjoy a good cup of yogurt once in a while. I my recent effort to eat smaller portions and more frequently, I bought some yogurt as a breakfast/morning snack option. Per my brother <a href="http://www.federalfriday.com" target="_blank">Ryan</a>’s suggestion, I grabbed a few of the Greek yogurt cups. They have something like 12 or 13 grams of protein in them and they’re only $1 at Wal-Mart. As far as yogurt cups go, they’re <em> terrible. </em>As far as protein sources go, they’re <em>amazing</em>! This has led me to the following relationship:
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="display: block; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" title="MmmProtein" src="http://www.sethgholson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/MmmProtein.png" border="0" alt="MmmProtein" width="287" height="221" /></p>


Note that as the quantity of protein in a food rises, the tastiness plunges. That’s not to say that things with protein aren’t tasty. Steak is both high in protein and very yummy! But if you take a steak and pour protein powder on top of it, you’ve ruined a perfectly good thing.

On the other hand, if you could somehow extract all of the protein out of a big fat juicy steak, you’d have mana from heaven.

On your next visit to the grocery store, find a product that has a second “healthier” version with lots of protein. Buy both and alternate bites. I bet the protein enriched version tastes like Mountain Dew if citrus were poop.

The secret to building a lot of muscle is simple: sear your taste buds.
