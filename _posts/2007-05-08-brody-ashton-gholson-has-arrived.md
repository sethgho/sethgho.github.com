Never has any day brought about as much respect for women in my mind as today. To any of you ladies reading this, I humbly bow. You truly are the superior sex. I am forever in debt to my wife Jen for the 12 hour day she worked today to bring our adorable little boy into this world. It was a long hard road beginning at 6 AM when we arrived. A couple of hours in the doc broke her water and shortly thereafter began what seems to be long term bruising to my hand. She worked hard all morning long breathing through contractions. Not once did I hear a four letter word. In fact, rarely did we even hear a peep from her. She calmly took each contraction at a time one by one with hardly the slightest utterance. For that alone, I’m beyond proud of her. It wasn’t until almost 2 that afternoon that she received the magic injection. The true impression was made beginning around 8 PM when the real pushing could finally begin. Hooray! It’s almost over– or so we thought. This girl pushed, and pushed, and pushed for an hour and a half. By golly I’ve never counted to 10 so many times, so hard, or so loud as I did tonight. I was exhausted. I was exhausted… from counting… to 10. How she felt afterwards, I will never understand. We should all pat her on the back for a job well done the next time we see her. I’ll be doing so for years to come.

I suppose most of you would like to see the little fruit of her/our labor. I’ve created a photo album on Flickr. The link is below. I don’t think any of the pics have caught it yet, but he has a well defined dimple on both cheeks.
