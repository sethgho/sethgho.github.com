<h1>MENU LINE GEORGE </h1><a href="http://sethgholson.com/george">sethgholson.com/george</a>



<p style="">My home town of Shreveport, LA has a very unique hospital cafeteria. <a href="http://christushealthsb.org/">Christus Schumpert Hospital</a>'s daily phone-in cafeteria menu is nearly always narrated by Cafeteria Team Leader George Cauthen. This isn't your ordinary hospital cafeteria menu, though. George adds a southern evangelical flair to his recording that must be heard to understand. I was first introduced to this when I worked in IT for a clinic on the Christus Schumpert campus. George has dished out some fantastic sound bytes over the years, but once the day is over they're gone forever. Needing a quick and simple project to explore iOS development I could complete while on paternity leave (because newborns are a breeze, right?), preserving these calls seemed like a great little project. The three main hurdles were:

<ul>
	<li>Calling</li>
	<li>Managing</li>
	<li>Apps</li>
</ul></p>	

<h2>CALLING AND RECORDING</h2>
<p>After a few different iterations using a couple of different languages and APIS, I'm currently running a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> app on a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> employing <a href="http://twilio.com/">Twilio</a> to initiate and record the calls. Twilio lets me download the file in MP3 format, which is passed up to <a href="https://parse.com/">Parse</a>.</p>

<h2>ADMINISTRATION</h2>
<p>Because I'm using Parse for my back end, I require no server side code. Using their Javascript SDK, I created a web app hosted on Github Pages to manage these recording. <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> allowed me to us a simple MVC pattern. <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> gave me a grid system and some halfway decent standardized controls.</p>

<h2>CLIENTS</h2>

<p>My first verison of the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/menu-line-george/id440761181?mt=8">iOS app</a> was created using the <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/platform/titanium-platform/" title="AWFUL">Titanium Mobile</a>. Using a cross platform framework like this was a wrong decision. Versions 2.x and 3.x were rewritten in Objective-C.</p>

<p>The Android client is targeting 2.3.x (Gingerbread)+ using the native Java SDK. Currently still in development, it should be completed and available in Google Play relatively soon. </p>

<p>Though not a full client, I've also added a simple web based player for sharing. This is useful for generating links via the sharing mechanisms in the mobile app.</p>
